# BLA_crossSpecies

## Study Design
This project, led by Michael Totty, Rita Juanes, and Svitlana Bach, provides an in-depth transcriptomic analysis of amygdala cell types across human and two non-human primate species. By leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), the study successfully discovered and characterized the molecular diversity of neuronal cell types found within various subregions of the amygdala, including the lateral (LA), basal (BA), accessory basal (aBA), and central nuclei (CeA).

This dataset includes high-quality snRNA-seq data generated from multiple human and non-human primate donors, allowing for cross-species comparisons and the identification of conserved transcriptomic profiles. The data serves as a valuable resource for understanding the transcriptional architecture of the amygdala and its implications for psychiatric and neurological diseases.

The data from this study includes thousands of nuclei from human and non-human primates. Both raw and processed data are publicly available, making it a useful resource for future studies into BLA functionality and its role in neuropsychiatric conditions.

### Key Objectives:
- Transcriptomic characterization of the amygdala across primate species.
- Cross-species comparison to identify conserved cell-types.
- Discovery of conserved novel marker genes for amygdala subnuclei across species.
- Determine cell type enrichment for genes associated with psychiatric disease.

### Explore the Data Interactively
We have developed interactive tools that allow you to explore the transcriptomic data at the single-nucleus level for each species. These tools enable you to create custom visualizations, download figures, and export the underlying code for your analyses.
