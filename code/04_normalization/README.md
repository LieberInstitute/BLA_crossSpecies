# BLA cross-species project: 04_normalization

The <normalization.R> script log-normalizes all three datasets. This normalization is ultimately not used and all of the data is re-normalized after being combined prior to batch correction. The save file names are however used in <05_batch_correction> scripts, so I've kept this step for now.
